This txt file is the pseudocode of the programme to create a right-aligned pyramid in the Mario Bros game.

prompt the user to input an integer between 1-8 inclusive for the height of the pyramid
if the user types something that is not valid e.g. not between 1-8 or not an integer
    reprompt
until the user types an integer that is valid

create a right aligned pyramid by using the for loop
write 1 hash on the first line i.e. the tip of the pyramid 
write 1 more hash on every next line.
continue to print lines hashes until the height of the pyramid reaches the integer indicated.
